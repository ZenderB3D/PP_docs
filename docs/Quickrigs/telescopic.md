#Telescopic Pistons 
    
You can easily add more rods and remove them, to/from any pistonpusher piston by selecting the rod and any piston object. Then open the quick rig menu and the options should be available.
  
These rods should be simple cylinders during set up, with their origin at whichever end is closed to the B empty. Once set-up, you can add detailing objects and parent them to their respective rod bones.

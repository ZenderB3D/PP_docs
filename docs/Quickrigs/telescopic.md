#Telescopic Pistons 
    
You can easily add more rods and remove them, to/from any pistonpusher piston by selecting the rod and any piston object. Then open the quick rig menu and the options should be available.
  
These rods should be simple cylinders during set up, with their origin at whichever end is closest to the B empty. Once set-up, you can add detailing objects and parent them to their respective rod bones.  
  
The operator provides feedback in the form of blue and red lines and a green dot. These are relative indicators representing min/max leading and trailing distance values. The green dot in particular can be somewhat misleading/useless for rod N > 2 as it always represents the stopping location as if it were the second rod.

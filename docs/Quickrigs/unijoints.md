#Universal (cardan) joints  
  
PistonPusher offers cardan/universal joint assets. These come rigged and can easily be combined with a piston of choice using the quick rig system.  
    
The universal joint armature has two sides, a control side and a track side. The track side should always be adjecent to the piston. After placing the cardan joint, you should select its armature and either the piston cylinder section or piston rod or whatever object happens to be in that location, roughly(in that order). The objects can be replaced, but the bones should remain untouched. Feel free to save your own variations for re-use!

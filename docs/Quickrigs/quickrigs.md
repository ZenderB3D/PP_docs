# Quick Rigs  

Quick Rigs, as the name implies are a collection of operators that can quickly rig a selection of objects.  
  
It currently has 4 options:  

* Simple piston  
* Cable/Hose  
* Add Cardan Joint  
* Combine cardan joint with piston  

It's found in the pop up menu tools section. The contents of the type dropdown menu are context sensitive. They rely on fairly simple assumptions, mostly about origins. An example are the simple piston rigs. The object origins become the pivot points of the resulting rig.  
  
This video demonstrates how the simple piston and cable/hose options work.

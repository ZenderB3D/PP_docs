# Quick Rig System

The quick rig system is essentially a sort of context sensitive operator switch-board. With it you'll be able to rig almost any kind of piston. It has some other features as well but the most important thing to remember is that the options available always depend on your selection or lack there of.
  
Contrary to the older creation modes, the quick rig system allows you to work regardless of orientation.

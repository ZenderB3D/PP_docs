#Set up stretch rig  

If you want a stretchable piston rig, you can select the object(s) that should stretch and open the quick rig menu. This operator does require that the origins are in a sensible place as they are used to determine which side the object belongs to. To use the operator properly, a rod object should be specified as well. Lastly, all object rotations should match that of the armature.

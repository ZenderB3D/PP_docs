# Simple Piston

This tool can be used with a selection of two objects. These objects may have children which will be re-parented accordingly. Note that the rotations of the root level objects are used to define the plane your actuator will operate in.  
  
By default, the tool will re-align the local orientations of all actuator objects. To do so properly, in some cases, most notably vertical set ups(z axis), the 'use axis' *axis*(not the toggle!) may have to be changed.  
  
Lastly, there's a button with a *refresh icon*, this may be used for advanced set ups where one mount is rolled relative to the other.

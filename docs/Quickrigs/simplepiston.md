# Simple Piston

The fastest and simplest way to make a piston. Origins should be set to their pivot point. To-be cylinder should be the active object. Orientation and/or applied transforms do not really matter. Cardan joints work with quick rig pistons as well. See re-do panel to change track constraint type.

It works really well with bevel shader materials. Note that it only supports two objects!

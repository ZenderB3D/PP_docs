#Installation

You can install pistonpusher like most other add-ons. Open blender, go to preferences, click on addons, click on 'install...' and select the pistonpusherxxx.zip where you downloaded it. Don't forget to activate it. You do not need to set an assets path anymore but it's still an option.  
  
There is also a K- and decal(machine) pack, see the Kit ops/Decal Machine documentations on how to install them.  

#Updating

If replacing the files fails for some reason:

First remove the add-on in blender and then restart the client. Now you should be able to re-install the add-on safely.


#General usage

All features are accessible from the pistonpusher pop up menu. The default shortcut is **SHIFT+E**.(Can be changed in add-on preferences)  

Assets come in the form of a blender asset library that's registered once you load a new file/restart blender after installation.

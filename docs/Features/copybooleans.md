#Copy booleans  
  
This tool can copy booleans from **one** object to the active object, object dimensions are not accounted for. Can be used to copy the booleans from 'cap' objects to either side of the piston if desired.  
  
All copied cutters are parented to a control empty named: 'booleans_ctrl'.

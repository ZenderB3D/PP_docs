#Snap and Drag tool
  
A bit of a weird tool that can facilitate object to object snapping by clicking on an object and then releasing the mouse on another. Once done, it transitions to a slide/scale/stretch/rotate operator.  
  
It also has a view-based anchor snap mode that's only available if you click on a piston armature or b empty. it expects that you assume a side view which is only used to set a rotation. A target object is still required to set a location. If you don't release on an object but empty space, it'll use the 3d cursor.  
  
In slide mode, pressing 1, 2 or 3 for an axis that's already active will offset the object in the direction of the set axis, you can press I to invert the offset direction.

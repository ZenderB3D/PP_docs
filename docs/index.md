# What is pistonpusher

Pistonpusher is an add-on that can quickly rig pistons/actuators in a special way. There are also features to help integrating them. These pistons are special in the sense that they are far more flexible than pistons made with bare minimum solutions.


**Advantages**

 * Pistons can easily be made longer and shorter. In both retracted/extended states. This behavior is disabled with a single click.
 * Pistons can exist out of any number of objects.
 * Individual elements can rotate freely, think of the rod, mounts and cylinder themselves. 
 * (inverted) telescopic pistons are supported.
 * Pistons are easily removed from a scene.
 * Easy to place and connect to a model/armature.
 * Custom object and collection management system to keep order among all these objects.(No duplicate names if you took the time to name objects) 
 * Instances of a type are derived from the first instance that was placed meaning you can edit multiple pistons in a target scene easily.
 * Materials can be added beforehand.
 * Very flexible.


# Why?

The add-on was brought to life to make concepting easier. I'm not very good at drawing and I prefer to model it and get an idea of what it could look like. Where it really shines is if you want to take concept art a notch up. All together, it's very easy to get things animated with these tools. So there's some utility outside the scope of pistonpusher.



# For who?

There's potential for concept artists but also animators. They animate quite well, joints can be included. Pistonpusher does most of the leg-work and offers a solid way to re-use your pistons.


# What can it not do?

Pistonpusher is really a dedicated solution for pistons. It's not a complete rigkit. There are tools that provide the option to quickly get moving footage but you're by no means forced to use these and can simply use the add-on to support your own methods/workflows.

# Custom piston mode

Please refer to the various (longer) videos to see how the custom mode can be used. It's not a different system than the template mode. Just a more manual approach to it. Templates are fairly constrained and rely on pre-made parts. The custom mode gives the user more responsibility. Mounts have to be handled but there are tools for this.  
  
It can handle most if not all workflows that one can think of. It was also added to allow users to rig pistons from external sources.  

Most importantly, collections are used to decide which object belongs to which part of the piston, in abstract terms. Origins matter as well but mainly for rigs that can stretch.

>This tool creates a piston like object out of objects. If you use it on a cylinder, it will assume the length and radius of that cylinder. It can also spawn one at world origin.

>In- and extrusions can be added and even randomized(raise random seed value above 0). The influence values are essentially multipliers that increase the effect.
